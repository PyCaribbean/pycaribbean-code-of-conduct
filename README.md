pycaribbean-code-of-conduct
=====================

This is a "fork" of the 2013 PyCon code of conduct. 

PyCaribbean considers itself part of the Python Community, as part of it we share the same love for diversity and respect.

That's why we follow the same principles stated in the Pycon Conference code of conduct.
